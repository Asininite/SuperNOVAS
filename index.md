__SuperNOVAS__ is a light-weight C/C++ astronomy software library, providing high-precision astrometry such as one 
might need for running an observatory or a precise planetarium program. It is a fork of the Naval Observatory Vector 
Astrometry Software ([NOVAS](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas_info)) C version 3.1, providing bug fixes and 
making it safer and easier to use overall.

SuperNOVAS is entirely free to use without any licensing restrictions.  Its source code is compatible with the C90 
standard, and hence should be suitable for many older platforms also. It is light-weight and easy to use, with full 
support for the IAU 2000/2006 standards for sub-microarcsecond position calculations.

SuperNOVAS is maintained by Attila Kovacs at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian, and it available
via the [Smithsonian/SuperNOVAS](https://github.com/Smithsonian/SuperNOVAS/) GitHub repository.
