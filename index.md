__SuperNOVAS__ is a C/C++ astronomy software library, providing high-precision astrometry such as one might need 
for running an observatory or a precise planetarium program. It is a fork of the Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry 
Software ([NOVAS](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas_info)) C version 3.1, providing bug fixes and making it safer 
and easier to use overall.

SuperNOVAS is entirely free to use without any licensing restrictions.  Its source code is compatible with the C90 
standard, and hence should be suitable for many older platforms also. It is light-weight and easy to use, with full 
support for the IAU 2000/2006 standards for sub-microarcsecond position calculations.

SuperNOVAS is maintained by Attila Kovacs at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian.
